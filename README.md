A Godot Wild Jam [31] game by
Idey / Izloople

This isn't the same as the submitted jam game, because I've updated it since (not final version yet)
I'm still learning so some or all of the scripts here may not be an example to learn from
And it's pretty messy as well

but hope you enjoyed the game!
